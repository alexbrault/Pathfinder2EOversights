* `p.26`: "they find an *owlbear claw* (*Pathfinder Core Rulebook* **570**)".
  The *owlbear claw* is listed on page **569**.
* `p.32`: The map is orientated with the entrance to the west.
  The names of rooms B4, B5, B10 and B11 as well as the information Pib and Zarf

  The sidebar on `p.33` and other references to cardinal directions appear to be
  consistent with the map as printed
