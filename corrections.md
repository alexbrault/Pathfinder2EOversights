# Core Rulebook

* `p.17` The **Single Actions** heading is very washed out.
* `p.20` under Ability Score Overview; Ancestry: "If you are taking any voluntary flaws, apply them in this step (see the sidebar on page **24**)". This should be page **26**.
* `p.22` Champion key ability score is listed as **Strength**. Should be **Dexterity or Strength** like the Fighter and Ranger on page 23. Sidenote: I notice on the more detailed class pages, (p.105, 141, and 167), the key ability is listed the other way around as "Strength and Dexterity". Not exactly an issue, but wondering if it's worth being consistent between the two areas.
* `p.26` in Step 7: "Likewise, record your character's **their** armor proficiencies in the...". Word should be deleted.
* `p.34` in Society: "**Today's dwarves today** retain". Remove one of the "today"s.
* `p.41` in Universal Longevity: "changing the skills you selected with **Elven Longevity** and Expert Longevity". Is this meant to be referencing **Ancestral Longevity**?
* `p.44` in Gnome Weapon Familiarity: "You are trained with the glaive and kukri. In addition, you gain access to all uncommon gnome weapons." The kukri doesn't have the gnome tag, and is uncommon. Is it just missing the gnome tag then?
---
* `p.52` and `p.59`: Halfling and Orc Weapon Familiarity ancestry feats are missing the line "For the purpose of determining your proficiency."
* `p.62` in "Field Medic" description: "You gain the **Battle Medic** skill feat." The feat as listed on `p.258` is named **Battle Medicine**.
* `p.73` in Chirurgeon research field: "lesser antidote, less antiplague, or **lesser** elixir of life". This should be **minor** elixir of life, right? Found by [/u/HereWeGoTeddy on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/ciqr0d/chirurgeon_class_feature_gives_lesser_elixir_of/).
* `p.75` in Perpetual Infusions: "Mutagenist: Choose two of the following formulas: lesser bestial mutagen, **lesser bullheaded mutagen**...". There is no bullheaded mutagen in this book.
* `p.75` in Perpetual Infusions in Bomber: "lesser bottled lightning, **lesser liquid ice**, lesser tanglefoot bag...". Should be "**lesser frost vial**".
* `p.84` in Rage: "You deal 2 additional damage with melee **weapons** and unarmed attacks." Worth changing to **attacks** just to make sure no one thinks Rage can be applied to thrown melee weapons?
* `p.86` in Table 3-3 Animal Instincts: The deer has the trait **Charge**. Looks like this isn't a valid trait.
* `p.91` in Thrash: "plus your **ferocious specialization** damage". What is that? Is that meant to be **weapon specialization**? (Credit to [/u/boomstik101](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/cfomkf/barbarian_ferocious_specilization_damage/) on Reddit.)
* `p.91` in Sudden Leap: Missing the 2 action icon that is found on the feat of the same name in Fighter's feats on `p.149`. Note: Fighters and Barbarians share multiple feats. The fighter feat also has a special tag that includes interactions the **Felling Strike** but this is probably because Barbarians do not have access to **Felling Strike**.
* `p.93` in Dragon Transformation: "your breath weapon DC increases to 30". Isn't this leftover from the playtest? Shouldn't this instead be something like being able to use the barbarian's Class DC?
* `p.96` in Bard Advancement: "10: Ability **boots**, bard feat, skill feat". Should be **boosts**.
* `p.97` in Adaptive Adept: "or prepared spells just like the cantrip from Adapted **Spell**". Should be Adapted **Cantrip**.
---
* `p.103` in Effortless Concentration: This version for the bard has a requirement of having not acted on your turn yet. Is it on purpose that this is different from the version that Druids (p.138), Sorcerers (p.201), and Wizards (p.213) have, which only have a trigger of their turn beginning?
* `p.132` Table 3-11: Based on the text for primal spellcasting on page 130, should the Druid have **5** cantrips at all levels instead of the currently listed **4**? ([Credit to Runnetib](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=4?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#164), there is dev confirmation that this should be 5).
* `p.139` in the Primal Wellspring feat: "Prerequisites: **Wild Focus**". Should be "Prerequisites: **Primal Focus**".
* `p.139` in Monstrosity Shape: "add the phoenix form listed in **aerial form** to your wild shape list". Phoenix form is actually listed in **monstrosity form**.
* `p.145`: Page number is blocked by fighter's foot.
---
* `p.156` in Mystic Strikes: "However, you still need an item such as **handswarps of mighty fists**...". Should be "**handwraps of mighty blows**".
* `p.157-158`: Does it say anywhere that monk spells start on page 401? Worth considering adding?
* `p.159` in Mountain Stance: "Trigger You are unarmored and touching the ground" should be "Requirements You are unarmored and touching the ground".
* ~~`p.162` Ki Monk question: Is this sidebar saying that Wisdom is supposed to be the key ability for a monk's ki/spell attacks?~~ [Confirmed by Errata](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/crgobt/pathfinder_2e_errata_from_the_designers/) that Ki spells use a monk's Wisdom.
* `p.162` in sidebar: "Higher-Level Feats: **Mountain Stance (1st)**". Should be **Ki Strike (1st)**, as many of the other listed feats require it.
* `p.170` in Ranger Feats sidebar: "To the Ends of the Earth" and "Triple Threat" have the same background color instead of alternating.
* `p.176` in Stealthy Companion: Doesn't list Animal Companion as a prerequisite.
* `p.184` in Minor Magic: Sweet, the Rogue gets spells. What ability do I use for the spell DC? There's also no trained proficiency in Spell DC or Spell Attack Roll.
* `p.184` in Scoundrel sample rogue: Trap Finder sounds like an odd starting feat.
* ~~`p.194` Are Sorcerers supposed to get **Resolve** at level 17? It's on the character specific sheet, and they're the only spellcaster to not get it, creating a strange gap between level 15 and 19. (Credit to [Elfteiroh](https://paizo.com/people/Elfteiroh).)~~ [Confirmed by Errata](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/crgobt/pathfinder_2e_errata_from_the_designers/) that sorcerers should get the Resolve class feature at 17th level, same as the wizard.
* `p.195` in Reading a Bloodline Entry: "You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, **in addtion to those you gain through sorcerer spellcasting**". Does this contradict the Spell Repertoire section? Is this a holdover from the playtest?
* `p.199` Is Bespell Weapon a level **four** feat like the main entry says, or level **six** like the sidebar says?
---
* `p.201` in Greater Mental Evolution: Missing the "Occult" trait.
* `p.201` in Greater Mental Evolution: Mentions **mental essence** which was a concept from the Playtest. Should this be **mind essence** or something else?
* `p.201` in Greater Vital Evolution: Missing the "Primal" trait.
* `p.201` in Metamagic Mastery: Last sentence has an extra period.
* `p.206` in Sample Spellbook: **study aura** is listed as a cantrip. This cantrip doesn't exist. Is this supposed to be the **read aura** cantrip?
* `p.209` in Familiar: "You make a pact with creature". Should be "You make a pact with **a** creature".
* `p.212` in Clever Counterspell: "Prerequisites: Counterspell, **Quick Recognize**". What is Quick Recognize? Is this meant to be the **Quick Identification** skill feat? Or **Quick Recognition**?
* `p.214` in Animal Companions: "An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows your orders without you needing to use **Handle an Animal** on it". Should be **Command an Animal**.
* `p.216` Is the Support benefit of the horse really meant to result in the same damage regardless of whether you use a Jousting weapon or not?
---
* `p.255` in Table 5-2 General Skill Feats: Automatic Knowledge: "Recall Knowledge as a free action once per **day**". Full description on `p.258` says once per **round**.
* `p.273` in Broken: "An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points **below** its Broken Threshold". This feels inconsistent with page 272 where it says "when its Hit Points are **equal to or lower than**". Which is it?
* `p.274` in Bulk: "This entry gives the armor’s Bulk, assuming you’re wearing the armor and distributing its weight across your body. A suit of armor that’s **carried or worn** usually has 1 more Bulk than what’s listed here". This should just be **carried**, right? Since the previous sentence deals with when it's worn.
* `p.275` in Padded Armor entry: There's a strength value of 10, but no check or speed penalty. Is this on purpose?
* `p.275` in Chain shirt entry: "Flexible, **Noisy**". Lowercasing to **noisy** makes it consistent with both the rest of this table column, and the "Weapon Traits" column in the weapons tables.
* `p.278` in Critical Hits: "When you make an attack and roll a natural 20... or if the result of your attack exceeds the target's AC by 10, you achieve a critical success." A nat 20 does not guarantee a critical success.
* `p.278` in Improvised Weapons: What proficiency bonus do players use for improvised weapons?
* `p.284` in Bastard Sword: "...it can be held in one hand or used with two hands to provide extra **piercing** or slashing power". Bastard swords don't deal piercing damage.
* `p.287` in Candle: Doesn't list a duration.
* `p.288` Mark Seifter mentioned in the Know Direction podcast that the item "Adventurer's pack" should have a Bulk of **1** instead of **2**. [Double confirmed by errata](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/crgobt/pathfinder_2e_errata_from_the_designers/)
* `p.292` in Torch: Doesn't look like the torch lists a duration.
* `p.293` vs `p.563` Is a Minor Healing Potion 3 or 4 gp?
* `p.295` in Table 6-18 Barding: If you can get animal armor with Heavy Barding that grants an AC bonus of +3, why does `p.214` say that animal companions are limited to gaining a +2 AC item bonus?
* `p.298` in Disbelieving Illusions: Last sentence has an extra period.
---
* `p.307` in "Charm", `p.308` in "Paralyze", and `p.309` in "Dominate". All three short-text versions of these spells reference targeting a "humanoid", but the full spell descriptions don't specify that the target needs to be humanoid.
* `p.322` in "Charm" and `p.390` in "Charming Touch": [Colette Brunel](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42pdf?Charm-Charming-Touch-and-Identify-Magic) points out that these spells mentions of Identify Magic doesn't make sense. Is it meant to be Recall Knowledge? Also, the condition appendix says that PCs aren't affected by the friendly and helpful conditions, so do these spells not do anything to PCs?
* `p.326` in Continual Flame: Heightened versions of the spell say what the gold cost increases are, but not what actual effect that comes with.
* `p.327` in Crusade: "You issue a divine mandage to the targets. **you** pronounce...". Should be capitalized? Or is there even a word missing?
* `p.331` in Disrupt Undead: Missing the Cantrip tag.
* `p.334` in Eclipse Burst: **Critical Failure** isn't bolded.
* `p.343` in Harm spell: "You disperse **positive** energy in a 30-foot emanation". Should be **negative** energy.
* `p.349` in Magic Aura spell: "A caster using detect magic or **study aura**...". This cantrip doesn't exist.
---
* `p.356` in Pest Form: "You transform into **a** the battle form of a Tiny animal". The extra "a" should be deleted.
* `p.368` in Shadow Siphon: "instead take only half as much damage**.** but...". The period should be a comma.
* `p.370` in Sound Burst: Critical Failure says stunned 1 for 1 minute. This sounds like an oddly long time.
* `p.397` in Splash of Art: "**Sluggish** 1 for 1 round". What's the Sluggish condition? Is this meant to be the **Clumsy** condition?
* `p.398` and `p.405` **Touch of Undeath** is the name of two different spells for the Cleric and Sorcerer. Seems worth renaming one of them.
---
* `p.409` in Atone spell: "Heightened (**5th**)". Based on the rest of the spell, is this meant to be **+1**?
* `p.441` in Whispering Way: No follower alignments.
* `p.441` in Domains table: **Ambition** domain is listed before the **Air** domain. Should be the other way around.
---
* `p.454` "Paralyzed: **You** body is frozen in place." **You** should be **Your**.
* `p.454` "Stupefied: **Your** can't access your full mental faculties,...". **Your** should be **You**.
* `p.455` If I look up "Reach" in the index, it won't take me here. It only refers to the reach weapon trait.
* `p.456` Many of the red dots for the lines are off-center.
* `p.458` in Affliction Example: "Succeeding at your second save would reduce the stage **t** by 1 to stage 1...". I'm not sure if that was meant to be something or if should just be deleted, lol.
* `p.476` in Flanking: To flank a foe, you and your ally must be on **opposites sides** or corners of the creature. Change to **opposite sides**.
* `p.477` in Cover: "The line between the centers of their spaces doesn't pass through any block terrain, but does **passes** through Valero's space." Change to "**pass**".
* `p.479` in Exploration Activities: "...If you **to** do nothing more than make steady progress toward your goal,...". Word should be deleted.
* `p.489` in Planning a Session Part 2: "Plan a time for everybody will arrive,...". Missed a word? Change **for** to **when**?
* `p.491` in Adjudicating the Rules, second bullet: "(page **XXX**)" More placeholder text.
* `p.491` "If you don't find one, make up an undefined action (page **XXX**)." Looks like leftover placeholder text.
* `p.499` near the top: "Don't do this if it's absolutely clear another kind of check **matters more sense than** Perception". Perhaps, "**makes more sense than**"?
---
* `p.535` in Consumable: "as well as ammunition oils, potions, scrolls". Missing a comma between "ammunition" and "oils".
* `p.544` in Splash Trait: "For example, if you threw a less acid flask and hit your target, that creature would take 1d6 persistent acid damage and 1 acid splash damage". It would also take an additional point of acid damage, as listed on the very last line of this page.
* `p.552` in Giant Wasp Venom: "Stage 3 4d6 poison and clumsy". Missing the word "**damage**" after "poison".
* `p.556` in Armor Alternatives: Per a quote from Mark Seifter (thanks, PF Discord!), looks like the intention was that Bracers of Armor are supposed to have their listed dex cap of +5 from page 607.
* `p.572` in Bag of Holding: How is it held in two hands if you're able to put and remove items from it like a mundane sack?
* `p.583` in Shadow: The stateblock says "Rune 5+", but the lowest-level version is Level 3.
* `p.586` in Mithral Shield: Standard-grade has a bulk of **L**. Looks like it should be **1**.
* `p.594` in Staff of Necromancy: The Greater Staff of Necromancy adds the spell **Enervation**. This spell appears to not exist in this book.
---
* `p.618` in Broken: "An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points **below** its Broken Threshold.... If an effect makes an item broken automatically... that effect also reduces the item's current HP **to the Broken Threshold**. Kind of minor, but seems worth clearing up the inconsistency.
* `p.635` in rarity: "Anything that doesn't list a rarity is common. 13, **535**, GM advice 488". Should be **534**.
* `p.680` in Hidden: "when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it **fails affect** you". Replace with "**fails to affect**".

## Core Rulebook PDF

* `p.376`: The bookmark for the Sunburst spell is misspelled as **Sunbirst**.

# Bestiary

* `p.134` in Draconic Frenzy: "The frost drake makes two **gang Strikes**". Should be "**fang Strikes**".
* `p.150`: The Air Mephit has a +19 Reflex save. This is high to a statistically significant extent for a level 1 creature. See note at the bottom of this post.
* `p.157`: The Faerie Dragon has a +16 Perception. This is high to a statistically significant extent for a level 2 creature. See note at the bottom of this post.
* `p.174` in Storm Giant: **Sense Motive** is listed as one of its skills.
* `p.195`: Grikkitog says "Resistances 10 (except adamantine)". What kind of resistance? Physical? All?
* `p.208` in sidebar: "the crafting of a soulbound doll (page **306**)". Should be **304**.
* `p.255` in sidebar: The Shoggoth is listed as a variant ooze, though the Shoggoth doesn't have the Ooze trait. Also, the Shoggoth is listed as being on **p.297**, when it's on **p.293** instead.
* `p.293`: Constrict attack has no DC against it. Is this on purpose?
* `p.330` **Wolfsbane** sidebar and Core Rulebook Wolfsbane-entry (page 553) don't agree on effects of Wolfsbane on lycanthropy. (Allow re-save vs. curse for creatures not transformed yet vs. 'immediately cured of the lycanthropy')
* `p.340` in Zombie Abilities, Rotting Aura: "Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester". No damage type is specified, should probably be **negative**.
* `p.351`: "Skum" on page 12 are not included in the index by level.
* `p.355`: The Pixie is listed as being on p.**310**. It should say **309**.

# Character Sheet Pack

* Many of the fighter's odd-level class features were misprinted in their even-level class feat boxes, making those boxes unusable.

# Other Notes/FAQ Candidates

* ~~Ok. So. The Faerie Dragon. [Deadmanwalking](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=2?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#81) pointed out that +16 seemed like a high perception for a level 2 creature. Now, I'm a data nerd. I wasn't going to include that without statistically proving that. So.....I went through the bestiary and tracked what all of their perception bonuses are. And [sure enough, here we have it](https://i.imgur.com/7YJQIQA.png). That data point of 16 is anomylously high compared to all the other perception values for level 2 creatures. Is this on purpose or ok? I'll leave that up to Paizo folks. Either way, wow I commit to these rabbit holes, lol.~~ [Confirmed by Chapter 2 of Game Mastery Guide preview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/d16rwm/everything_we_learned_about_the_gamemastery_guide/) that some monsters are just really good at something every once in a great while.

* ~~[Elro the Onk](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=3?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#112) noted in a similar vein: the air mephit (elemental) has an anomalously high Reflex save (+19). As with the faerie dragon and Perception, it's not out of meme for the creature to have a high score in the stat, but it's similarly *so* high that it's probably a typo of some sort. (For the data nerds: the spread on Reflex saves is +0-8 for L-1, +4-8 for L0, +1-11 for L1 (excluding the air mephit's +19), and +3-12 for L2. That's all I've analysed so far!)~~ [Confirmed by Chapter 2 of Game Mastery Guide preview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/d16rwm/everything_we_learned_about_the_gamemastery_guide/) that some monsters are just really good at something every once in a great while.

* [Fowlj](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=2?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#85) mentioned oddities with the "gold left over" sections for each class' kits. I fully admit I am out of brain power to look into all of those. Worth double checking the math on how much gold each class kit actually costs though.

* [Pramxnim](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=2?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#86) mentions that on page 377, the spell Telekinetic Projectile has you make a ranged attack, rather than a spell attack roll, and that this is inconsistent. I would actually say that I can see how a ranged attack could make sense. Since you're essentially throwing an improvised weapon. It just happens that you're throwing it with telekinetic force rather than your actual physical hand.

* Making note of confusion around Improved Evasion on `p.170` and p.182, [Mark Seifter clarified](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42ndr&page=2?KnowItAll-The-Fluffiest-Feat-Ever#52). Similar confusion on p.85, 99, and 157.

* [RicoTheBold](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=2?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#70) posted some interesting questions that are more FAQ candidates.

* [Dalvyn](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=3?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#115) has another FAQ/Errata candidate.

* Another clarification request from [Nightwhisper](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=3?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#126).

* Noted both [here](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=3?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#119), and [here](https://github.com/VestOfHolding/Pathfinder2EMistakes/issues/2), it's not always clear to everyone that referring to, say, an Intimidation skill feat, is talking about the group of skill feats associated with the Intimidation skill.

* As brought up [here](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=3?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#136), there's something odd about the Monk Dedication feat.

* [Andrew Mullen](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=3?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#140) noticed that the 8th level barbarian feat, Animal Rage, doesn't seem like it does much.

* [Seems worth looking into this discussion on mutagen rules](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=4?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#170). This linked post it only the latest in an ongoing conversation about what might be some leftover text from the playtest, and generally [Brew Bird](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=4?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#169) points out multiple possible issues with the way mutagens are written.

* There are only 2 actions in the game currently that have a cost attribute in their blocks outside of spells and rituals, Channel Smite and Quick Alchemy. Cost does not appear in the feat/action block description on 'p.18' and these would make more sense to be rewritten as requirements.

* [RAI clarification on applying poison to ammunition and ammunition retrieval](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nmp&page=4?TyposMistakesEtc-in-2E-Books-Collection#196) would be great.

* There are some odd edge cases around dead/dying when, for example, a character is reduced to zero HP by another creature's reaction. [Discussion and suggested errata change here.](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42owo?Locking-Yourself-Out-of-the-Game-and-Other#14)

* Sanity check: Is it expected that at level 19, a fighter's proficiency in unarmed attacks jumps from expert to legendary, with no other ability since level 1 improving that expert proficiency?

* Sanity check on Death's Call on `p.391`: Is it meant to use your Wisdom modifier even when Wisdom isn't your casting stat?

* There's some [oddities and discussion here](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42nr6?Wounded-and-taking-damage-while-dying) around the rules for taking damage while wounded.

* Looks like by RAW, you could grapple, trip, etc, swarms. Pulling back on the harsh rles from PF1e is great at least.
