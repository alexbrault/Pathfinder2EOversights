# Lost Omens Character Guide

* `p.45` in Incredible Luck: "if you have Helpful Halfling, you can still use ***Halfling Luck*** on an ally instead of yourself only once per day."
  Helpful Halfling doesn't interact with Halfling Luck.
  The sentence seems to actually describe Shared Luck.
* `p.85`: Hellknight Signifer Dedication has as a prerequisite "spellcasting class feature".
  This concept is poorly defined; it's unclear if multiclass spellcasting feats count.
  This should have "Cast a Spell activity" as a prerequisite instead.
