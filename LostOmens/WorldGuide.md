# Lost Omens World Guide

* `p.8, p.27`: The year of Deskari's death and sealing of the Worldwound is in conflict. p.8 lists it as 4713 AR, p.27 lists it as 4718 AR.
* `p.28`: The Aldori dueling sword is mispriced.
  It should cost 20 sp instead of 20 gp.
  (Confirmed by Eleanor Ferron)
* `p.48`: Vudrani is listed before Tien, out of alphabetical order.
* `p.71`: The **Crimson Shroud** feat doesn't have a tradition trait.
  It should probably have the *Divine* trait as Red Mantis Assassins use Divine spells and the ability was Supernatural in first edition.
* `p.71`: **Crimson Shroud** grants fast healing.
  Fast healing is only defined in the Bestiary.
  There should be a reference in the Glossdex.
* `p.72`: The Kelish language is misspelt as Kelesh.
* `p.84`: The Garundi language is listed, but doesn't exist in the Core Rulebook.
  Should this be Osiriani?
* `p.95`: The **Magic Warrior Dedication** feat should have the *Uncommon* trait.
  (Confirmed by Luis Loza)
* `p.95`: **Nameless Anonymity** allows the magic warrior to cast *nondetection* but doesn't say which tradition is used.
  It should say the spell uses the same tradition as the magic warrior's focus spells.
