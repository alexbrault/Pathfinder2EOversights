# Pathfinder 2E Oversights
A central listing of all the typos/oversights/potential errors/etc found in the initial books launched for Pathfinder 2E.

I try not to add too many things related more to just the rules being ambiguous, or otherwise FAQ candidates, in order to try and control the scope of this list, though you may notice I give mention to a few possible FAQ candidates people have raised in the last section of this.

## Corrections

* [Core products](./Core)
* [Adventure Paths](./AdventurePaths)
* [Modules](./Modules)
* [Lost Omens](./LostOmens)

## How to Contribute

If you know of an error that isn't on this list, there are a few ways you can tell me:

1. If you know Git and some basic markdown, you can make a pull request against this repo and I'll verify it with my own book and approve the PR.
2. You can submit an issue against this repo up in the `Issues` tab and I will add it to the list, closing the issue when I have added it to the list.
3. Make a post in [this thread on the Paizo forums][update thread] which I also check periodically for newly found errors.
